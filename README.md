# Reinforcement-Learning-Project
Developed Deep Reinforcement Learning models to solve OpenAI's car racing environment, tackling the issue of lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles.

# Project Details
Project Aim: Developing Deep Reinforcement Learning Models for Autonomous Vehicles Using Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms 

Project Objectives:
- Conducted extensive model training and evaluation using PPO algorithm and a CNN to process a 96x96 image pixel as input - 150,000 timesteps was the optimal training time
- Model Tuning - PPO Hyperparameters were tuned using random and grid-based approaches to yield the best reward
-  Reward Function Modification - The reward function of the environment was modified to promote smoother driving and better track adherence. See Report and Video

Project was simulated on gym software package.

Note: The trained model files were too big to upload in Github but the final tuned model with the modified reward function is available on video
