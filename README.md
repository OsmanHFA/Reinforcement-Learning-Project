# Reinforcement-Learning-Project
Developed Deep Reinforcement Learning models to solve OpenAI's car racing environment.
Project was simulated on gym software package.
Project involved three stages:
1) Model Training - 150,000 timesteps was found to be the optimal training time for this environment, yielding desirable results
2) Model Tuning - PPO algorithm was used and PPO parameters were tuning using random and grid-based approaches
3) Reward Function Modification - The reward function of the environment was modified to promote smoother driving and better track adherence. See Report and Video
